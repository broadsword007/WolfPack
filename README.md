## How to build and run this program?
As mentioned earlier, the program is built over Qt Framework. So you will need  to install Qt toolkit ([Latest version](https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.9/5.9.0/) recommended). Once Qt is installed you need to install just one dependency Library [PcapPlusPlus](https://github.com/seladb/PcapPlusPlus) to get every thing right. Library PcapPlusPlus's build instructions are given [here](http://seladb.github.io/PcapPlusPlus-Doc/download.html), however, you can download prebuilt binaries from the same link. After completing these just do these steps to run the program.

- Start Qt Creator in administrative mode (For Linux), for windows administrative mode is not required
- Open the .pro file located in the root directory.
- Now just click the run button to start the project
